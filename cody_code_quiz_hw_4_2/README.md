Know your code! Coding quiz challenge.

Note: This is unfortunately an unfinished project. Planned to be resubmitted for grading ASAP.

The questions are multiple choice. 

Once all questions are answered, or the time has run out, the game is over and the user can then choose to submit there initials and log their high score to a high score "leaderboard"

This leaderboard is stored on local stoarage, and the user can choose to clear the board.
